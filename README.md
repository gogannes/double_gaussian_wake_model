# DoubleGaussianWake

## Project
This project is the implementation of the Double Gaussian Wake model for wind turbines published in the article:

Schreiber, J., Balbaa, A., and Bottasso, C. L.: Brief communication: A double-Gaussian wake model, Wind Energ. Sci., 5,
237â€“244, https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-5-237-2020, 2020.

## About the wake model
The analytical wind turbine wake model assumes a double-Gaussian velocity distribution.
The choice of a double-Gaussian shape function is motivated by the behavior of the near-wake region that is observed in
numerical simulations and experimental measurements.
The method is based on the conservation of momentum principle, while stream-tube theory is used to determine the wake
expansion at the tube outlet.

The model parameters used in this repository have been identified for a scaled wind turbine model (TUM-G1) and may
depend on wind turbine characteristics.
